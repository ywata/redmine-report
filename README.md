# redmine-report

Retrieve issues information from Redmine server using Redmine Rest API.
It is intended to generate my weekly report.

Building the software
Currently, dependency for RedmineHs is not completed and does not build by itself.

TODO:
This work highly depends on  RedmineHs(https://github.com/lookunder/RedmineHs) but
the dependency is not included in cabal file currently. I'll update cabal file after
I finish my code.
